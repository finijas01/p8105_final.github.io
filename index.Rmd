## Introduction

## Website Overview

## Dataset

In this project, the dataset we used is [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Childcare-Center-Inspections/dsg6-ifza), which is obtained from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

This dataset contains a list of all inspections conducted and any associated violations at active, city-regulated,

center-based child care programs and summer camps over the past 3 years. The violations are pre-adjudicated.

Violations that are subject to potential penalties (fines) are submitted to NYC Office of Administrative Trials and

Hearing where they are adjudicated as either sustained/upheld or dismissed. The dataset also contains additional

information on the programs, including license information. For more information on child care in NYC visit:
